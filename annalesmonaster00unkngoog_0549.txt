⁸ eomes down to the year 1292, where it ends abruptly. The history is particu-
larly valuable for notiees of events in the eastern portions of the kingdom.
which are not to bc elsewhere obtained, and some curious facts are mentioned
relative to the floods in that part of EnglamL which are confirmed in the Fries-
land Chronicle of Anthony Heinrich, pastor of the Islaud of Molir.

These Poems are perhaps the most interesting of all the historical writings of
the period, though they cannot be relied on for accuracy of statement. They
are various in character3 some are upon religious subjects‚ some may be called
satireS, and some give no more than a court scandal; but as a whole they pre-
sent a very fair picture of society, and of the relations of the different classes
to one another. The period compi-ised is in itself interesting, and brings uS,
through the decline of the feudal system, to the beginning of our modern
history. The song-s in old English are of considerable value to the philologist.

by J. S. Bnnwnn, M.A., Professor of English Literature‚ King’s
Collega, London. 1859.

This is the celebrated treatise--never before printed—so frequently referred
to by the great philosopher in his works. It contains the fullest details we
possess of the life and labours of ltoger Baeon: also a flagitent by the same
author, supposed to be unique, the ‘⁶ Contpendt'um Studia· Tlteo ye‘oe.’'

and Assistant Tutor of Trinity College, Cambridge. 1859.

The author, a monk of Nor-wich, has here given us a Chronicle of England
stom the arrival of the Saxona in 449 to the year 1298. in or about which year
it appears that he died. The latter portion of this history (the whole of the
reign of Edward 1. more especially) is of great value, as the writer was contem-
porary with the events which he records. An Appendix contains several illus·
110ῑίνο documents connected with the previous narrative.

Edited by the Rev. Jorm Wunaus AB Irni-312, M.A. 1860.

This work, also known as ‘⁸ The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales‚” has

been attributed to Caradoe of Llancarvan, who flourished about the middle of

the twelsth century. It is written in the ancient Welsh language, begins with

the abdication and death of Caedwala at Rome, in the year 681, and continues
the history down to the subjugation of Wales by Edward 1.. about the year 1282.

This volume, like all the others in the series containing 0 miscellaneous selec·
tion of letters, is valuable on account of the light it throws upon biographical

history, and the familiar view it presente of characters, manners, and events.
The period requires much elucidation3 to which it will materially contribute.
