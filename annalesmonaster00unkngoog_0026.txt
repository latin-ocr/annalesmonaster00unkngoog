It was in the third year of Henry the Sixth, either
A.D. 1424 or 1425, that one william (p. 6), a. tenant of
the Abbot‚ living at ¹ Marsord, in the parish of Sand-
ridge, near St. Alban’S‚ being afflicted with blindness in
a spirit of devoutness caused ἐι wooden cross to be
erected on the right hand side of the high road leading
to Codicote‚ over Max-ford Bridge ; a statue of the Virgin
Mai-y, in alabaster, being also placed near it. Such
memoriale of the piety of former ages are still plentifully
in existence in Roman Catholic countrieS, but with us
probably they have nearly all passed away.2

part of the heath (bmaera) of Barnet Wood which was

‘ then known as the “ field of Monkdych,’' and ³ belonged

to the Abbey Almoner’s department. The plea on the
part of the townsmen wem, that they might have the
opportunity of erecting tw'o besselles, or archery-butts‚
on the ground so cleared. On referring to the Appentlix‚
however (p. 428), a passage will be found, in which it is
suggested that this was done with the view of encroach-
ment only, and that it was in a ⁴ captione spirit that all
this was devised and worked out; it evidently being,
according to the anonymous writer there, (who expresses
himself in language that only just misses being utterly
unintelligible), the intention of the townspeople at once
to encroach upon the Abbey property and curtail the
