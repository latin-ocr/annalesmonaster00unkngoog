This volume contains the narrative of an eye—witness who details with con-
siderable power and minutencss the circumstances which attended the final ex-
pulsion of the English from Normandy in the year 1450. The history commences
with the infringement of the truce by the capture of Fougeres, and ends with
the battle of Formigny aad the embarkation of the Duke of Somerset. The
whole period embraced is less than two years. -

Neekam was a. man who devoted himself to scienoe, such aa it was in the
twelsth century. In the “De Naturia Bermn'’ are to bc found what may be
called the rudimenta of man sciences mixed up with much error and ignorance.
Neokam was not thought i ‘ble‚ even by his contemporaries, for Roger Bacon
renurks ofhim‚“ thinAlexanderin many things wrote what was true and useful z
“ but he neither can nor ought by just title to be roekoned among authorities?
Neckam, however, had sufficient independenee of thought to differ from some
of ·the schoolmen who in his time considered themnelves the only iudgee of litem-
ture. He had his. own views in morale, and in giving ua a ghmpse of them, as
well as of his other opinions, he throwa much light upon the manners, eastum,
and general tone of thought prevalent in the twelfth century. The poem entitled
“ De Laudibus Divinae Sapientioe ’' appetu to be a meti-ioal paraphrase or
abridgment of the “De' Naturia Rerum! It is written in the elegiae metre;
and though there are many linea which violate oin-esical tales, itis, aa a whole,
above the ordinary standard of mediaeval Latin.

Thin work illustratee not only the history of soience, but the history of super-
stition. In addition to the information bearing directly upon the medical skiu

light upon the general mode os life and ordinary· diet. The volumes are interesting
not only in their acientiflc, but also in their sociat aspect. The manuscripts from
which they have been printed are v‘aluable to the Anglo·Saxon scholar for the
iumtrationn they afford of Anglo·Saxon orthography.
