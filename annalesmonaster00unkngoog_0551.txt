and translated by Beuum Tnonrs, Esq., Member of the Royal
Academy of Sciences at Munich‚ and of the Society of Netherlandish

Literature at LeJden. 1861.

This Chronicle‚ extending from the earliest history of Britain to the year
1154, is justi-y the boast of England3 for no other nation can produce any history,
written in its own vernacular, at all approaching it, either in antiquity‚ truthful-
ness, or extent, the historical books of the Bible alone excepted. There are at
present six independent manuscripts of the Saxon Chronicle, ending in different
years, and written in different parts of the country. In the present edition, the
text of each manuscript is printed in columns on the same page, so that the
student may see at a glsnce the various changes which occur in orthography,
whether srising from locauty or age.

The Paper-s are derived from MSS. in the Public Record office, the British
Muscam, and other repositories. The period to which they refer is unususlly
destitute of chronicles and other sources of historical information, so that the
light obtained from these documents is of special importance. The principal
contente of tho volumes are some diplomatic Papers of Richard ΠΙ. 3 correspon-
dence between Henry VII. and Perdinand and Isabella of Spain3 documents
relating to Edmund de la Pole, Earl of Snffolk 3 and a portion of the corre-
spondence of James IV. of scotland.
