Friars Hermits of England shortly before the year 1464. His Chronicle extends

The first is a poem in Norman Fremh. containing 4,686 lines, addressed to
Alianor, Queen of Henry ΙΙΙ.. and probably written in the year 1246, on the
occasion of the restoration of the church of Westminster. Nothing is known
of the author. The second is an anonymous poem, containing 536 lines, mitten
between the years 1440 and 1450, by command of Hem-y VL, to whom it
is dedicated. It does not throw any new light on the reign of Edward the
Confessor, but is valuable as a specimen of the Latin poetry of the time. The
third, also by an anonymous author, was apparently written for Queen Edita,
between the years 1066 and 1074, during the pressure of the suffering brought
on the Saxons by the Norman conquest. It notices many facts not found in
other writers, and some which differ considerably stom the usual accounts.
