These annale, which are in Latin, commence in the year 44⁷, and come dovn
to the year 1288. The earlier portion appears to be taken from anIu'sh Chronicle,
whichvas also usedby'l'igernach,andbythe compileroftheAnnalsofUlster.
During its first century it contains scarcely anything relating to Britain, the
earliest direct concurrence with English history is relative to the mission of
Augustine. Its notiees throughout ²h⁰²⁸1¹3² brief, are valuable. The annale
were probably written at St. Davids, by legewryd, Archdeacon of Llandaff,
the most learned man in his day in all Cymru.

London. Vola. V. and VI. Edited by the Rev. «hams F. Damon,
M.A.‚ Rector of Barnburgh, Yorkshire. 1861-1868. ·

The first three volumes contain the historical works of Gerald du Bar-ry, vho
lived. in the reigns of Henry Π., Richard 1., and John, and attempted to re-
establish the independence of Wales by restorin the see of St. David: to its
ancient primacy. His works are of a very misce laneous nature, both in
and verse, and are remarkable chiefly sor the racy and original anecdotes which
they contain relating to contemporaries. He is the only Welsh writer of any
importance who has contributed so much to the mediaeval literature of this
country, or assumed, in consequence of his nationality, so free and independent
a tone. His frequent travels in Italy. in France, in lreland, and in Wales, gave
him opportunities for observation which did not generall fall to the lot of mediaeval
writers in the twelsth and thirteenth centuries. and of ese observations Gir-aldus
has made due use. Only exmcts from these treatises have been printed before,
and almost all of them are taken from unique manuscripts.

The To gra hia nibemica (in Vol. V.) is the result of Gir-aldus' two visits to
Ireland. ¹lghe rst in the year 1183, the second in 1185-6, when he accompanied
Prince John into that count-ry. Curious as this treatise is, ΜΓ. Dimock is of
opinion that it ought not to be accepted as sober tmthful history, {or Gimldus
himself states that truth vas not his main object, and that he compiled the work
for the purpose of sounding the praises of Henry the Second. Elsewhere, how·
ever, he declares that he had stated nothing in the Topographia of the truth of
which he was not well amared, either by his own eyesight or by the testimony.

of this treatise is devoted to the animala of Ireland. It shows that he was a very
accurate and acute observa, and his descriptione are given in a way that a
scientific naturalist of the present day could hardly improve upon. The Expug-
