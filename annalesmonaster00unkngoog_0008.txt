The works to be published in octavo, separately, as
they were finished3 the whole responsibility of the task
resting upon the editors, who were to be choscn by the
Master of the Rolls with the sanction of the Treasury.

'Phe Lords of Her Majesty’s Treasury, after a careful
consideration of the subject, expressed their opinion in a
Treasury Minute, dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
· recommended by the Master of the Rolls “ was well
calculated for the accomplishment of this important
national object, in 611 effectual‘ and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention
’116 paid to economy, in making the detailed arrange-
ments‚ without unnecessary expense.''

They expressed their approbation of the proposal that
each Chronicle and historical document should be edited
in such a manner as to represent with all possible cor-
rectness the text of each writer, derived from a collation
of the best MSS„ and that no notes should be added,
except such as were illustrative of the various readings.
They suggested, however, that the preface to each work
should contain, in addition to the particulars proposed
by the Master of the Bous, a biographical account of
the author, so far as authentic materials existed for that
purpose, and an estimate of his historical credibility and

value.
