This is one of the many mediaeval chronicles which assume the character of a
history of the world. 1t begins with the creation, and is brought down to the
author's own time, the reign of Edward ΙΙΙ. Prefixed to the historical portion, is
a chapter devoted to geography, in which is given a description of every known
land. 'l'o say that the Polychronicon was written in the fonrteenth century is to
say that it is not free from inaccuracies. It has, however, a value apart from its
intrinsic merita. It enables ns to form a very fair estimato of the knowledge ot*
history and geography which well-informed readers of the fou-teenth and flstoenth
centu-ies possessed, for it vas then the standard work on gena-al history.

The tvo English mndations, which are printed with the original Latin, afford
interesting illustrations of the gradual change of our language, for one was made
in the sourteenth century, the other in the flstcenth. The ciffus-enea between
Trevisa’s version and that cf the unknown writer are osten considerable.

These two treatises, though they cannot· rank as independent narratives, are
nevertheless valuable as caresul absa-acts of previous historiam, especially “ Le
Livere de Reis de Engletere.” Some various readings are given which are
interesting to the philologist as instances of semi-Saxomsed French.

It is supposed that Peter of Ickham must have been the author, but no certain
conclusion on that point has been arrived at.

The Abbey of Meaux was a Cistaelan house, aud the work ofits abbot is both
curicus and valuable. It is a faithful and osten minute mord of the establishment
of a religionis community, of its progress in forming an ample mvenue, of its
struggles to maintain its acquisitione, and of its relations to the governing
institutione of the country. In addition to the private affairs of the monastery,
some light is thren upon the public events of the time, which are however kept
distinct, and appear at the end of the history of each abbot’s taminiae-afim. The
text has been printed from what is said to be the autogr-aph of the original
compiler, Thomas de Burton, the nineteenth abbot.

'rhe exact date at which this work was written is, according to the chronicler,
1250. The histo is of considerable value as an illusuation of the period during
which the author ἷῖνοᾶ, and contains a good summary of the events which followed
the conquest. This mmor chroniele is, however, based on another work (also
written by Matthew Paris) giving fuller details, which has been called the
‘ Historia Major! The chronicle herc published‚ nevertbeless, gives some
informatiou not to be found in the greater history.
