the narrative itself. A brief analysis of each work has been added when decerving
it, in which the original portione arc distinguished from those which are mere
compilations. When possible, the sources are indicated, from which cuch com·
pilations have been derived. A biographieal sketch of the author of each piece
has been added, and a brief notice has also been given of such British authore as
