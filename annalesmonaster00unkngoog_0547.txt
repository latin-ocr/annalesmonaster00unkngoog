men had been extended to the field of theology, and they appear both in the

This is a metrical translation of a Latin Prose Chronicle, and was written in the
first half of th'e leth century. The narrative begins with the earliest legentis,
aud ends with the death of J ames L of scotland. and the ‘⁶ evil ending of the
naitors that slev him.” Strict accur-acy of statement is not to be looked for in
such a work as this ς but the stoi-ies of the colonization of Spain, behind, and
Scotland are interesting if not true3 aud the chronicle is valuable as a reflection
of the manners, sentimenta, and character of the age in which it was composed.
The peculiarities of the Scottish disiectare vell illustrated in this metrical version,
and the student of lang-uage vin find ample materials for compar-ison with the
English dialects of the same period, and with modern lovland Scotch.
