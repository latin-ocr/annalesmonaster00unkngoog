been a man of a restless and turbulent disposition3 for
in the reign of the late King, Henry the Fisth, 116 had
been committed to the Tower on suspicion of treason.
In the first year of the succeeding reign he made his
escape; the first escape, no doubt, that we find men-
tioned in the preceding extract. On being again ap-
prehended, as we learn from the State Τνὸαῑε, 116 was
indicted and convicted under the Statute of Escapes,
and, after sentence, executed at Tyburn. He was ac-
cused also of various other offences, though not tried
upon those charges. It was alleged by one King, who
bore witness against him, a servant of Sir Robert Scot,
Keeper of the Tower, that 116 had agreed to give him
forty pounds for assisting him to escape, with the
promise of a future earldom; and that he had further
told King that, aster his escape, 116 would go to the
Earl of March in WaleS, raise forty thousand men there,
re-enter England, and cut off the head, as well of the
Duke of Gloucester, the then Protector, as of the Bishop
of winchester. Als0‚ that he had further alleged that
the Earl of March was the rightful heir to the crown,
and that aster him the next heir was himself: and that
iu case the Earl should recover his right, 116 himself
would assume the regal power as his due. Lastly, that
if the Earl should refuse to accept his services„ he would
fiy to Franco, and aid the French King against England.
A slight outline of the particulars of Mortimer's indict-
ment before a London J ury, at Guildhall, is to be found
in the printed Roas of Parliament, Vol. IV., p. 2023 but
without any reference (beyond mention of a “ Schedule
“ annexed '’) to the charges above quoted.

In page '7 we meet with a singular story of a spurious
ambassador, who had the impudence to present himself
at the English Court. In 1116 double capacity of’ im-
postor and imperial envoy, he could not dispenso with a

m‘hmstom title, of course; and accordingly, the“ Baron de Blaka·
