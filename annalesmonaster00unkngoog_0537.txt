As far back as the year 1800, a Committee of the House of Commons
recommended that Indexes and Calendars should be made to the Publio
Records, and thirty-six years asterwards another Committee of the House of
Commons reiterated thet recommendation in more forcible words; bnt it
was not until the incorporation of the State Paper Office with the Public
Record Office that the present Master of the Rolls found himself in a position
to take the necessary steps for carrying out the wishes of the House of
Commoris,

On 7 December 1855, he stated to the Lon-da of the Treasury that although
‘⁶ the Records, State Papers, and Documents in his charge constitute the most
“ complete and perfect series of their kind in the civilized world‚” and
although “ they are of the greatest velue in a historical and constitutional
“ point of view, yet they are comparatively useless to the public, from the
“ want of proper Calendars and Indexesss’

Acting upon the recommendatione of the Committees of the House of
commons above referred to, he suggested to the Lords of the Treasury that
to effect the object he had in view it would be necessary for him to employ a
few persons fully q'ualified to perform the work which he contemplated.

Their Lordships assented to the necessity of having Calendars prepared

and printed, and empowered the Master of the Rolls to take such steps as
might be necessary for this purpose.

The following Works have been already published under the direction of
the Master of the Rolls 2-
