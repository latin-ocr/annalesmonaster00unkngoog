1866.

The “Book of Hyde ” is a compilation from much earlier sources, which are
usually indicated with considerable care and precision. In many cases, however,
the Hyde chronicler appears to correct, to qualify, or to amplify- either from
tradition or from sources of information not now discoverable-the statemeuts
which, in substance, he adopts. He also mentions, and frequently quotes from,
writers whose works are either entirely lost or at present known only by fragments.

Tbere is to be found, in the “Book of Hyde‚'' much information relating to the
reign of King Alfred which is not known to exist elsewhere. The volume
contains some curious specimens of Anglo-Saxon and Mediaeval English. .

There is, in this volume, a legendary account of the peopling of Ireland and of
the adventures which befell the various heroes who are said to have been con-
nected with Irish history. The details are, however, very me both for this

portion of the work are the invasions of foreigners and the wars of the Irish
among themselves. The text has been printed from a M S. preserved in the
librasy of Trinity College, Dublin, written partly in Latin, partly in Irish.

Itis probable that Pierre de Langtoft was a canon of Bridlington, in Yorkshire,
and that he lived in the reign of Edward 1.‚ and during a portion of the reign of
Edward ΙΙ. This chronicle is divided into three parts3 in the first is an
„bridgment of Geoffrey of Moumouth's “ Historia Britonum,” in the second, a
history of the Anglo-Saxon and Norman kings, down to the death of Henry 111„
and in the third a history of the reign of Edward 1. The principal object of the
work m apparently to show the justice of Edward’s Scottish vars. The
language is singularly corrupt, and a curious specimen of the French of Yorkshire.

The work in its present form, in the editor’s opinion, isa comparatively modern
version of an undoubtedly ancient original. That it was compiled stom contem-
porary materials has been proved by carious iucidental evidence. It is stated in
the account given of the battle of Cloutarf that the full tide in Dublin Bay on the
day of the battle (23 April 1014) coincided with sunrise; and that the returning
tide in the evening aided considerably in the defeat of the Danes. The fact has
been verified by astronomica] calculatione, and the inference is that the author of
the chronicis, if not himself an eye-witness, must have derived his information
from those who were eye-witnesseS. 'Ibe contents of the work are sufficiently
described iu its title. The story is told aster the manner of the Scandinavian

sagas, with poems and fragments of poema introduced into the prose narrative.
