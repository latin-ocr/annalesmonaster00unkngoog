cant indication of ohe Abbot of westminster‘s ownership
of the soil. On a certain night, however, in the seventh
year of Abbot Whethamstcde's rulc, AD. 1427, the
gallowe was hewn to the ground, by whom no one
knew, tho Chronicler says, though, eomewhat suspi-
ciously for ’che eruth of his medion, he tells us how
it was done, namely‚-“ by force of eworde and axes?
